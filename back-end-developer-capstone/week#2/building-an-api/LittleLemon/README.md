# Week#2: Building an API

**Brief Description:** This project demonstrates the creation of REST APIs within a Django application using the Django REST Framework. It focuses on building CRUD functionality for models (presumably menu and booking models, from your previous questions). 

## Installation

* **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.11 or newer
    * Django 5.0.4
    * Django REST Framework 3.15.1
    * MySQL (if using a MySQL backend)
    * mysqlclient 2.2.4
    * django-debug-toolbar 4.3.0 (for development)

* **Instructions:**
    1. Clone this repository. 
    2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    3. Install dependencies and create a virtual environment: `pipenv install`
    4. Activate the virtual environment: `pipenv shell`
    5. Configure database settings in the Django project's `settings.py` file.
    6. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate` 
    7. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Usage

* **API Documentation:** (This assumes you have API documentation set up;  if not, provide instructions on how a user can explore the API endpoints, either through Postman or a similar tool).
* **Example Interactions:** (If possible, provide a couple of examples demonstrating how to interact with your API endpoints using tools like curl, Postman, or HTTPie).

Given a staircase with n steps, you can climb each step by taking either one step or two steps at a time. Write an algorithm to determine how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.

def stairs(n):
	if n <= 2:
		return n
	return stairs(n-2)+stairs(n-1)


def stairs(n):
	if n <= 2: 
		return n
	memo = [0]*(n+1)
	memo[1] = 1
	memo[2] = 2
	for x in range(3, n+1):
		memo[x] = memo[x-2]+memo[x-1]
	return memo[x]
